			Git is version control system means it saved the files (to save the history of files). Git and Github both are different.
		</p>
		
		<p>First Download the GIT</p>
		
		<p>
			<br><b>git --version</b><br> 
			(By this command check the version of git or you can check git is installed or not
		</p>

		<p>
			<br><b>git config --global user.name "ImDwivedi1" <br>  
			git config --global user.email "admin@gmail.com" </b><br>
			This command sets the author name and email address to be used with your commits. Git config is also used in other scenarios.<br>
			Or you can directly change in file by this command<br>
			<b>git config --global --edit</b>
		</p>
		<p>
			<br>create repository, means the project which can be access from the git. So to make folder git repo write below command.<br>
			<b>git init</b><br>
			this will create a empty and hidden repository (.git) in the project folder. when we run this command a default branch "master" is created.
		</p>

		<p>
			<br><b>git status</b><br>
			this will show you the status of file, kuch change hua ho etc.
		</p>

		<p>
			<br><b>git add your-file or folder name</b><br>
			this will use to add particular files/folder<br>
			<br><b>git add .</b><br>
			this will use to add all files/folder<br>
		</p>

		<p><br>Now ab agr mene kisi file mai change kiya hai toh first mujhe us file ko add krna pdega using git add command than fir usko commit krenge </p>

		<p>
			<br><b>git commit -m " Commit Message"</b><br>
			This command changes the head. It records or snapshots the file permanently in the version history with a message. Jo change kiya ho vo message mai likh do (-m means message)
		</p>

		<p>
			<br><b>git log</b><br>
			This command is used to check the commit history. By default, if no argument passed, Git log shows the most recent commits first. We can limit the number of log entries displayed by passing a number as an option, such as -3 to show only the last three entries.
		</p>

		<p>
			<br>suppose we want to keep some files private so that git can't able to access those files. so for this create one file <b>(.gitignore)</b> file and under this file write the name of the file which you want to hide from git for example ignorefile.html. 
			<b>you can also hide .gitignore file by writing .gitignore in .gitignore file</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			<br><b>git branch</b><br>
			it is used to see all the branch, it is used for production and development for example multiple people are working on one project, so that we can create the branch for it.. so one developer work on that branch and other one on other branch. so the code can not get conflict. <b>before moving to new branch we must move to master branch.. so that we get the main code.</b><br><br>
			<b>git branch branch_name</b><br>
			it is used to create a new branch<br><br>

			<b>git branch --delete branch_name</b><br>
			used to delete the branch, but if we delete the branch the changes we've done under that branch will all go.<br><br>
		</p>

		<p>
			<br><b>git checkout</b><br>
			this is used to move from one commit to other commit and also to move to the other branch.
		</p>

		<p>
			<br><br><b>git merge branch_name</b><br>
			jb branch ko merge krna ho
		</p>

		<h2>GitHub</h2>
		<p>create an account on github</p>
		<p>Create a repo in github</p>

		<p>
			<b>git remote add origin https://github.com/shraddha845/learn_git.git</b><br>
			is command ko starting mai ek hi bar run krna pdta hai<br><br>

			<b>git branch -M main</b><br>
			agr branch pehle se bni ho toh ye command run krne ki need nhi hai, -M branch ko main branch bna degi and main is the branch_name<br><br>

			<b>git push -u origin main</b><br>

			Now our files are added to the github. main is the branch_name<br><br>

			<br><b>Jitni bhi bar hum file mai change krenge utni bar add,commit and push krna pdega.</b>
